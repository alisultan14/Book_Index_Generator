The project basically investigates how different data containers like ArrayList,
HashMap, and TreeMap work. This is done by reading from text format books and
creating an Index (containing all the words followed by the list of line numbers they
appear in ) of these books. We measure the time it takes to create the index and the
time it takes to write it to the output file for each of these data structures through
analysis of multiple runtime experiments.
